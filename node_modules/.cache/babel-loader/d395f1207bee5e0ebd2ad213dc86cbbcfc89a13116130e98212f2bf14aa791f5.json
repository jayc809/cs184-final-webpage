This is where we use join and glue operations. Join is used to\n          add two new edges around the newly added triangle. However, in some\n          instances, this ill end up with the boundary interesting itself. In\n          this case, we use the glue operation to remove this flaw with the\n          boundary, so that we maintain that the other side of a boundary edge\n          is always outside of the currently constructed mesh.{' '}\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Besides these functions, we used some data structures to keep track of\n          the details of the algorithm. To start, the point cloud itself is\n          stored as a list of 3D points, and a matching list of surface normals.\n          Throughout the algorithm, we use indices into these lists to refer to\n          points, as opposed to the actual points themselves. This is both for\n          ease of linking a point to its normal, and for the simplicity of\n          identifying points.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For the algirithm itself, we used two main data structures. To store\n          the advancing front, we used a list of doubly linked lists of edges.\n          The resaon we need multiple linked lists is that the boundary may\n          split in two during glue operations. Each edge stores its two points,\n          as well as the center of the ball used to define the triangle it is a\n          part of. This center is necessary to know where to start the ball\n          rolling in ballPivot steps. The second data structure we used was a\n          grid of voxels, used for storing the point cloud in a way that allowed\n          for accessing nearby points more easily. Throughout the geometric\n          steps above, (ballPivot and findSeedTriangle), it is only necessary to\n          know the points that are nearby when doing searches. Thus, it would be\n          a large waste of time to do searches across the entire point cloud,\n          when each step is only a local operation.{' '}\n        </p>\n\n        <img\n          src={BP}\n          alt='Ball Pivot Illustration'\n          style={{ display: 'block', margin: '20px auto' }}\n        />\n        <p>\n          On the other hand, Poisson surface reconstruction leverages the\n          principles of implicit surface modeling to generate a smooth and\n          continuous mesh from the input point cloud. By formulating the\n          reconstruction problem as a Poisson equation, the algorithm seeks to\n          find a function that best fits the input points while adhering to\n          certain boundary conditions. This approach is particularly adept at\n          handling noisy or incomplete point cloud data, as it inherently\n          incorporates regularization techniques to ensure robustness and\n          fidelity in the reconstructed mesh.\n        </p>\n        <div className='image-container'>\n          <img\n            src={Fish}\n            alt='Poisson reconstruction Illustration'\n            title='Possion'\n            width='1000'\n            height='450'\n            style={{ display: 'block', margin: '20px auto' }}\n          />\n          <div className='tooltip'>Poisson</div>\n        </div>\n      </Section>\n      <Section title='Problems Encountered and Solutions:'>\n        <p>\n          One significant challenge encountered was the debugging process,\n          requiring meticulous attention to detail to resolve issues and ensure\n          the reliability of the algorithm. There were two significant sources\n          for the majority of the difficulty of debugging the algorithm. The\n          first was that for a majority of the algorithm debugging process, we\n          had not yet made a means of visualizing the point cloud itself. This\n          made it difficult to see what was going wrong and to figure out what\n          might be the cause of the mistakes in the algorithm. Once we made a\n          visualization for the point cloud, debugging was significantly sped\n          up. The second cause for headache was a misunderstanding of the\n          polygon mesh to half-edge mesh conversion program we were using out of\n          the box. This led to us trying to fix a problem in the algorithm that\n          didn't exist, per se, when the real issue was a misuse of the mesh\n          visualization aspect of the program.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          As a general approach to tackle these challenges, a systematic\n          approach to debugging and problem-solving was employed, leveraging\n          collaborative efforts within the project team. Regular testing and\n          validation procedures help identify and address issues in a timely\n          manner, ensuring steady progress towards project goals.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Finally, there is a fundamental limitation of the algorithm itself,\n          which has to do with deciding the radius of the ball to use.\n          Essentially, if the radius is too big, then areas of the surface that\n          have tight curvature will not be detected by rolling the ball over\n          (see the image ). Whereas, if the radius is not large enough, it may\n          percieve boundaries of the surface where there aren't any if there are\n          gaps in the point cloud that are bigger than the ball itself.\n        </p>\n      </Section>\n      <Section title='Lessons Learned'>\n        <p>\n          {' '}\n          Through the development process, valuable lessons have been learned\n          regarding the complexities of mesh reconstruction from point cloud\n          data.

Given that we had done this, we would have likely\n          opted to first create a point cloud visualization first, seeing as we\n          could use that for the next step in the development process. Instead,\n          we went first for the interesting, fun part of the project, ultimately\n          leading to a longer and more arduous project experience.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Perhaps another important lesson we learned was a lesson in scope.\n          Initially, we had plans to do much more with the project, though we\n          did not end up accomplishing these goals.\n
